# Flow Free

## Background and Overview

Flow Free is a puzzle game with many different levels. Each level has a grid of squares with colored dots on some of the squares. The objective of the game is to connect dots of the same color by drawing lines between them such that the entire grid is filled without intersecting the lines. Typically, the larger the grid, the more difficult the puzzle.

Inspired by AirBnB, ezStay is a full-stack web application. The application was built with Ruby on Rails, React, and Redux. JavaScript ES6, PostgreSQL, and JS bundling was also used.

## Functionality & MVP

In Flow Free, users will be able to:

- [] Pick which difficulty of puzzle they want, easy, medium, or hard
- [] Connect dots to solve puzzle
- [] Hear sounds when connecting dots
- [] See how many moves they made
- [] See what perfect amount of moves is to complete each puzzle
- [] See percentage of grid filled
- [] Be notified when level is completed

## Architecture and Technologies

* Vanilla JavaScript
* HTML5 Canvas
* Webpack

`grid.js` will be the board with game completion logic

`dots.js` will have the dot connection logic

## Timeline

Day 1:

- [] Set up environment for grid

Day 2:

- [] Get dot connection and game completion logic working

Day 3:

- [] Create 20 levels to play

Day 4:

Implement:
- [] Sound
- [] Showing percentage of grid filled
- [] Show how many moves have been made

Bonus:

- [] Make game more complicated and more similar to 'Two Dots'
