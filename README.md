## Background and Overview

This is my version of Flow, built in JavaScript over the course of 4 days.

Flow is a puzzle game with many different levels. Each level has a grid of squares with colored dots on some of the squares. The objective is to connect dots of the same color by drawing lines between them such that the entire grid is occupied by lines. However, lines may not intersect.
